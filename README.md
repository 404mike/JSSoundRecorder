JSSoundRecorder
===============

Record sounds / noises around you and turn them into music.

Itâ€™s a work in progress, at the moment it enables you to record live audio straight from your browser, edit it and save these sounds as a WAV file.

There's also a sequencer part where you can create small loops using these sounds with a drone synth overlaid on them.

No servers involved, only Web Audio API with binary sound Blobs passed around!

See it working: http://daaain.github.com/JSSoundRecorder

TODO
----

* Code cleanup / restructuring
* Enable open / drag and drop files for editing
* Visual feedback (levels) for live recording
* Sequencer UI (and separation to a different module)
