JSSoundRecorder
===============

Record sounds/ noises around you and turn them into music. Itâ€™s a work in progress, at the moment we have a noise recorder that enables you to record live audio straight from your browser, edit it and save the finished sound / music as a WAV file.

No servers involved, only Web Audio API with binary Blobs passed around!
